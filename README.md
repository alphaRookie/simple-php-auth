# PHP Registration System (Learning Project)
This is my First ever project 

> Note: I haven't done this project yet, but i have to move to Laravel. So, The complete and perfect version will be in Laravel soon!

This project is for practicing a **user registration & login system**, including:
- Forgot password option 
- Storing user to Database
- Logged-in user can modify their data (username, birthdate, email, password)
- Basic security features using PHP Native
- Calculate and display user’s age from birthdate input
- Simple UI

This repo has several branches to show my learning process step by step:

- **original** → Initial version, simple code with minimal features and security, And simple UI.
- **progress-1** → Added some features and basic validations.
- **progress-2 (default)** → Structured file with MVC and advanced security (HTTPS, secure sessions, CSRF protection, email & password validation, password hashing, duplicate email, etc).

## How to Run It

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alphaRookie/simple-php-auth.git
